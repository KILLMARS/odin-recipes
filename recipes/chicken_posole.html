    <h2>Description</h2>

           shredded lettuce, finely chopped onion, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges, if you like.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 1/2 quarts chicken broth</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 cups white hominy, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>10 tostada shells</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat.
            Add chicken breasts and cook until no longer pink and juices run clear, 
            about 20 minutes; remove from skillet, drain, and cool. When completely cooled, 
            shred chicken with a fork.</ol>
        <ol>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat.
            Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until soft and transparent,
            about 5 minutes. Return shredded chicken to the skillet.
            Stir in chicken broth, water, chili powder, salt, and oregano.
            Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 90 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Stir in hominy and cook until tender, about 15 minutes more. Taste to adjust seasonings,
            adding more salt and chili powder, if desired. 
            Serve in soup bowls with a tostada shell. Garnish as desired.</ol>
