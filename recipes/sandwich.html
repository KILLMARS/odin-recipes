            <li>½ cup prepared horseradish (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ cup brown mustard (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
            Add steak and cook until browned. Add mushrooms,
             bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>In a slow cooker, combine beef broth, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce,
            red pepper flakes, and red wine. Transfer steak and vegetables to the slow cooker;
            stir to blend. Cover and cook on High for 3 to 4 hours,
            or until beef is extremely tender.</ol>
        <ol>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
            Drain liquid from the slow cooker and save for dipping.</ol>
        <ol>Slice French bread loaf lengthwise like a submarine sandwich.
            Mix together horseradish and mustard; spread onto the inside of loaf.
            Place slices of provolone cheese on both sides of loaf,
            then fill with steak and vegetables. Close the loaf and wrap with aluminum foil.</ol>
        <ol>Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven.
            For crunchier bread, you can bake it without the aluminum foil.
            Slice into 4 sandwiches; serve with the juices from the slow cooker for dipping.</ol>
